# Create your own Corpus Training data
Chatterbot is a very flexible and dynamic chatbot that you easily can create your own training data and structure.

Create or copy an existing .yml file and put that file in a existing or a new directory you created under `chatterbot_corpus\data\<NEW DIRECTORY>`
Edit that file with any text editor that you like to work with.

In the beginning of the file you set one or two categories.
```
categories:
- myown
- my own categories
````

Then can you start your actual training conversation data.

```
conversations:
- - Hello
  - Hello
- - Hi
  - Hello
```
